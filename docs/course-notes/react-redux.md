## 1. Managing State
### 1.1 Introduction
Welcome to Udacity's Redux course. The goal of this course is to help you learn how to more
effectively manage state in your applications. As a byproduct of that, you'll have to learn Redux along the way.

Now, you may find this course a little slow. That's on purpose. The reason we're going to take it slow is because historically Redux is pretty difficult to learn.

The problem isn't necessarily Redux itself, but everything else that you typically pair with Redux.

What happens is traditionally when you learn Redux, you also learn it alongside

- React
- React-Router
- React-Redux bindings
- and a few other helper libraries

This causes all sorts of issues because your brain has a hard time separating what's what.

To fix this, we're going to take a slow gradual approach.

1. We'll start off by looking at just Redux, nothing else.
2. Once you've mastered Redux itself, we'll add in some basic UI with just HTML and JavaScript.
3. Then, when you're feeling comfortable with hooking up Redux to a simple UI, we'll swap out that UI for React, and you'll learn how the two work together.
4. We'll then look at some common pain points when combining React and Redux, and we'll learn how the React-Redux bindings help solve these pain points.
5. Finally, we'll use Create React App to see how a real-world React and Redux app is built.

Now, we're covering quite a lot, but remember we're going to take it slow and go step-by-step.

#### 1.1 Lesson Roadmap
Since Redux is not a topic for beginners and can be a daunting area to break into. We've broken down your path to learning Redux into the following lessons:

- Lesson 1 - Managing State
- Lesson 2 - UI + Redux
- Lesson 3 - Redux Middleware
- Lesson 4 - Redux with React
- Lesson 5 - Asynchronous Redux
- Lesson 6 - react-redux
- Lesson 7 - Real World Redux

##### Lesson 1 - Managing State
You’ll learn techniques to make your state more predictable by moving your state to a central location and establishing strict rules for getting, listening, and updating that state.

##### Lesson 2 - UI + Redux
You’ll learn to move away from having state live in the DOM by creating a vanilla JavaScript application whose state is managed entirely by Redux.

##### Lesson 3 - Redux Middleware
You’ll learn to create custom middleware and add it to your Redux store. This middleware will allow you to enhance your store by hooking into and intercepting actions before they reach any reducers.

##### Lesson 4 - Redux with React
You’ll learn how to add React to a Redux application and have the state of that application be managed by Redux.

##### Lesson 5 - Asynchronous Redux
You’ll learn to better abstract asynchronous events by creating your own custom Thunk middleware and adding it to your store.

##### Lesson 6 - react-redux
You’ll learn to leverage the react-redux bindings in order to leverage the benefits of a UI library like React and a state management library like Redux.

##### Lesson 7 - Real World Redux
You’ll take your knowledge of Redux and utilize it by building a real world Redux application. You’ll also learn advanced Redux topics like reducer composition and normalization.

### 1.2 The Store
Think about any application you've ever made.
Most likely that app was composed of two things, UI and state.
Now, think of any bug you've ever had.
Odds are that bug was caused by state mismanagement.
Your application was expecting the state to be one thing,
but it was actually something else.
When your computer freezes and you have to restart it,
that's because some state inside of your computer got to a weird place.
By restarting it, you reset that state.
When a website says you have a new notification,
but you click on that and there's nothing new,
that's because the state of the app was mismanaged.
As I said previously,
the goal of this course is to make state management,
any app you build more predictable.
One of the best ways to improve the quality of the apps you
build is to improve the predictability of the state in an application. -->
